                  the sound of ideas and imagination being captured on paper.
                  And you could only do it when pencil meets paper (Not exactly

                      there is nothing better. Especially when it's in Italy.
                      There are millions of flavours to choose from, from the
                      basic chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, to unimaginable
                      flavours such as pistachio (as mentioned above), rice

                      Rowing on a gondola is also a supreme highlight of Italy.
                      Through the narrow red-bricked walls of Venice, you can
                      row a gondola through the silent ripple less streams in
                      Italy. As you paddle, the friendly and warm sounds of
                      cello may greet you as you row past some of the many
                      old-fashioned churches, through the narrow passages, or
                      under bricked bridges.

                      Deep in the mountains, the unfriendly north wind blows as
                      I ski down from the mountaintops of Marmot Basin Ski
                      Resort. The mountain is huge, so gigantic that the lift to
                      the top (called the Canadian Rockies Express) that it
                      takes at least five minutes. Around the mountain‚Äôs middle,
                      there is a midmountain restaurant, for any of the people
                      who need to stop and rest, or maybe get a chocolate
                      croissant, to those who are hungry.

                      We didn‚Äôt spend much time in Jasper‚Äôs unique downtown, but
                      we did spot the giant totem pole near the train station
                      and eat a delicious meal at Kimichi House. I especially
                      remembered the fact that my dad always woke up early to
                      get me and my mom a butter croissant and milk from the
                      Crazy Elk Cafe (Starbucks) before we went driving into the
                      mountains to ski.

                      Lake Louise is one of the most dazzling and magical lakes
                      you have to see. After a little hike in a ravine, we came
                      to a viewpoint where we can see the magical turquoise
                      waters of Lake Louise. We spent quite a lot of time taking
                      photos and enjoying this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The hike to see Lake was especially tiring so after the
                      long walk, we went to a restaurant called Maple Leaf to
                      eat fish and chips. Even though it took a long time to
                      serve, it was definitely worth it.

                      As you walk into a dim lantern litted restaurant, the
                      smell of peking duck rolls overwhelms you. If you take
                      one, bite, believe me, you will just have to take the
                      next. If you eat this in a restaurant one time, you just
                      have to come back again. And when I visited China, I ate a
                      lot.

                      Another tasty treasure you have to eat if you come across
                      one is a particularly special and unique sweet. I ate this
                      in a streetside shop and it was ice cream wrapped in a
                      waffle. It was delicious, the waffle was slightly warm and
                      crispy, while the ice cream was soft and sweet.
